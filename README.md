#Moddeus

Moddeus is a free, open source, 2d Platformer. It is developed in Java using LibGDX. The game is being developed as part of a school project (Computer Science A2 Coursework) and is a learning experience for me (I have never made a game before or used LibGDX). Hopefully it will eventually be finished and will be a fun little game to complete in an hour or two. Maps for the game are made using the Tiled tile map editor and all art assets are made in Paint.Net. As a side note the name "Moddeus" is the name of the main character (he doens't have much of a backstory) and is a random name I just picked when starting on this.

Currently the game - IS NOT - in a playable state.
